# All the Fuzzyness of Python

**Disclaimer:**

Although the original work and code was developed for PeriShipâ€™s Operational System, the code in this repository has being sanitized. All the data and reference tables related to PeriShip's work has been removed. The code in this repository is intended for evaluating the performance of Python package **Fuzzy Wuzzy** and **Rapid Fuzz** in a given scenario only.

If you are interested in my experience of designing and implementing a solution to a business problem using **Fuzzy String Matching**, please dive in my article [All the Fuzzyness of Python](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/all-fuzzyness-python-zhuoyi-zhao/?trackingId=PoTnRhRl2rW7FwPfV%2FJJTg%3D%3D).
